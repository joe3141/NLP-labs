Several indigenous leaders attending Francis’ final event of the day have been fighting the policies of Mr. Correa to expand oil exploration in the Ecuadorean Amazon.\\n\\n“The tapping of natural resources, which are so abundant in Ecuador, must not be concerned with short-term benefits,” Francis told a group of civil society leaders at his final stop of the day. “As stewards of these riches which we have received, we have an obligation toward society as a whole, and toward future generations.”\\n\\nFrancis had been expected to address the exploitation of the Amazon, after specifically including the issue in “Laudato Si’,” the environmental encyclical he released to worldwide attention last month.

Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, is a longtime leftist critic of the church, yet on Thursday he spoke before the pope and praised him.\\n\\nFrancis’ criticism of multinational corporations and global capitalism has already brought him criticism and suspicions among some who question the leftist tint of his ideas.\\n\\nMr. Morales, a fierce critic of American corporate influence, wore a white shirt and a dark jacket bearing a picture of the Communist revolutionary Che Guevara on the left breast.\\n\\n“For the first time, I feel like I have a pope: Pope Francis,” Mr. Morales said.\\n\\nFrancis has filled four consecutive days with appearances, but other than an environmental critique offered in Ecuador, the pope had hewed mostly to theological topics or broad themes like family, service and mission.\\n\\nHis appearance on Thursday night was at the Second World Meeting of Popular Movements, a congress of global activists working to mobilize and help the poor. Some people wore Che Guevara T-shirts while some indigenous women wore traditional black bowlers.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nFrancis drew cheers when he called on the activists and others to change the social order: “I would even say that the future of humanity is in great measure in your own hands, through your ability to organize and carry out creative alternatives, through your daily efforts to ensure the three Ls — labor, lodging, land.”\\n\\nFrancis repeated his condemnation of an economic system rooted in pursuit of money and profits, but in an aside he criticized “certain free-trade treaties” and “austerity, which always tightens the belt of workers and the poor” — a likely reference to Greece.\\n\\n“Human beings and nature must not be at the service of money,” he said. “Let us say no to an economy of exclusion and inequality, where money rules, rather than service. That economy kills. That economy excludes. That economy destroys Mother Earth.”\\n\\nBut if Francis again called for change, he also offered no detailed prescription.\\n\\n“Don’t expect a recipe from this pope,” he said. “Neither the pope nor the church have a monopoly on the interpretation of social reality or the proposal of solution to contemporary issues. I dare say no recipe exists.”\\n\\nIn Latin America, Francis’ apology will likely draw the most attention, though he told the audience that Pope John Paul II had already apologized.\\n\\nIn 2000, John Paul made a blanket apology from the Vatican, asking forgiveness from Jews, ethnic populations on different continents and other groups. Francis’ apology was specific and made on Bolivian soil.\\n\\nYet Francis’s agenda for the trip includes bolstering the church, and he noted that many priests and laity had acted with courage on behalf of Latin America and said Catholicism was integral to the continent’s identity.\\n\\nOn the Road With the Pope Our Vatican correspondent, Jim Yardley, is traveling with Pope Francis as he visits Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay.

       "     'body': \"Perón’s alliance with the bishops was sealed when the 1943-46 military regime, in which he was vice president, made Catholic education obligatory in Argentina’s previously secular public schools. The process culminated in 1944 when Perón decorated a statue of the Virgin Mary with a military sash and appointed her a “general,” accompanied by a 21-gun salute.\\n\\n“Neither Marxists nor Capitalists. Peronists!” was the chant of Perón’s supporters. And it was borrowing from the church’s political thinking that enabled Perón to found his “Third Way.”\\n\\nToday, the church in South America is threatened not by Marxism but by the gradual drift of its faithful toward evangelical Protestantism, which offers a more direct relationship with God. With the largest slice of the world’s estimated 1.2 billion Catholics, about 28 percent, living in South America, this is a slide the Vatican can ill afford to ignore.\\n\\nIt comes naturally, then, to Francis, who became a priest in Argentina’s politically engaged church hierarchy, to adopt a populist political tone to combat that drift. He speaks directly to the region’s poor with a fire found in the “liberation theology” that inspired South America’s leftist revolutionaries of the 1970s.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But his thinking evolved. “If you were to read one of the sermons of the first fathers of the church, from the second or third centuries, about how you should treat the poor, you’d say it was Maoist or Trotskyist,” he said in 2010, when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires (and still known as Jorge Mario Bergoglio).\\n\\nThe catalyst for the fusion of ’70s liberation theology and ’30s conservative church activism that underpins Francis’ worldview can be traced to his encounter with a single extraordinary person. In about 1953, as a young apprentice at a pharmaceutical lab, he met Esther Ballestrino de Careaga, a chemist in her mid-30s who had campaigned for farm laborers’ rights in Paraguay and founded that country’s first women’s movement. “She’s the person who taught me to think,” Francis told Ms. Careaga’s daughter, Ana María, when the two met last month during the papal tour.\\n\\n“When I hear him speak today about the poor, the excluded, about everybody’s right to work and a roof over their heads,” she says, “I hear my mother’s influence.”\\n\\nFrancis and Ms. Careaga remained friends during Argentina’s 1976-83 junta, when thousands of opponents were murdered by the military, but each dealt with the dictatorship in different ways. She went on a collision course with the generals. He reportedly worked behind the scenes to save whomever he could from the carnage. Nevertheless, their friendship lasted until Ms. Careaga’s murder in 1977 at the hands of the regime.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nFrancis has been criticized for failing to take a more public stand — other church leaders paid with their lives for denouncing the crimes of the regime. Bishop Enrique Angelelli of the northern province of La Rioja was killed in 1976 for investigating the murder of two priests. But if Francis did not make himself a martyr, neither was he one of the many collaborators within the church hierarchy. When proceedings began this April to make Angelelli a saint, Francis came out in support.\\n\\nAlthough forged in the fiery crucible of the region’s politics, his outlook disavows the confrontational nature of most South American political thought — divided between Peronists and anti-Peronists, liberals and anti-imperialists, left and right. Francis’ blend of thought and tradition isn’t simply middle ground.\\n\\nThe friendship with Ms. Careaga holds the key. He did not share her ideology, but he adopted those values he found humanistic, universal and consistent with Christian teaching.\",\n",

Popes fathered wars, and children, had heretics executed or chained to a cell in the belly of Castel Sant’Angelo, the fortress that fronts Vatican City. The Vicar of Christ cut deals with dictators, including a devil’s bargain with Mussolini. With its institutional cover-up of pedophile clerics, the church showed the Mafia a thing or two about organized crime. In matters of sex, it was medieval and hypocritical. It was afraid of science.\\n\\nNow the pope uses science to shame Trump, who stares down a parade of hurricanes and says, nothing to see there. “Whoever denies it has to go to scientists and ask them,” said Francis last week. “They speak very clearly. Scientists are precise.” Can a statue of Galileo in St. Peter’s Square be far behind?\\n\\nOn Wednesday, a glorious Roman morning with a bite of fall in the air, the pope holds his general audience. The goofy smile is electric. He’s buoyant. The day before, Trump spoke to the United Nations, a tweet dressed up as a speech. He made a very real threat to wipe out a nation of 25 million people. He would, if he has to, “totally destroy North Korea.”\\n\\nThis has always been the implication of having more nukes than the other guy.

A few days earlier, Francis was asked about a Trump decision that could break up the families of 800,000 Dreamers in the United States. “If he is a good pro-life believer, he must understand that family is the cradle of life and one must defend its unity,” Francis answered.\\n\\nPeople who are hung up on doctrinal changes — angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin arguments over whether divorced Catholics can receive communion or not — are missing the big picture.

He will also meet with immigrants and refugees who had been assisted by Catholic Charities, including day laborers and a group of unaccompanied minors who formed a soccer league in the Bronx. The parish connected to the school was shuttered during a restructuring in 2007, reflecting challenges facing the Catholic Church in this country, with declining attendance and dwindling numbers of priests.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Nutter. He will later celebrate Mass at the conclusion of the World Meeting of Families, the centerpiece of his trip.\\n\\nThey are not the usual destinations for a pope, but zipping from the Financial District to East Harlem, and from a prison to a major Mass, promises to give him a view of the contours of American life.

In 2015, both United Airlines and Delta Air Lines started giving out reward points based on how much customers spend on airfare. This change means that the frequent flier “mile” is no longer directly related to distance traveled, and that high-spending corporate travelers get a lot more rewards than bargain hunters. American Airlines will make a similar change in July.\\n\\nThere is a logic to these shifts: Companies want to reward their most profitable customers, not necessarily their most frequent ones. At Starbucks, small spenders will lose out. A customer who likes drip coffee at $1.95 per cup will have to buy 32 of them to qualify for a free drink. But the change is good news for those who spend at least $5.21 per Starbucks visit, the minimum amount at which customers will earn rewards faster under the new program than the old one. And it’s especially good news for people whose job requires them to make Starbucks runs for the office.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nSome Starbucks customers on the losing end of the shift, despite disappointment about the deterioration of their rewards, acknowledged the company’s rationale in emails to me.\\n\\n“It feels like Starbucks values my business less because I’m spending less per visit, regardless of the fact that I’m in the drive-thru four to five days a week,” said Megan Johnson, a television news producer in Portland, Ore. “And on the surface, that’s fair, because obviously running a company is about profit, and I’m providing less of that.”\\n\\nIn the past, Starbucks said its rewards program was about bonding with all its customers, not about rewarding those who generate the most profit.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

My Starbucks Rewards is designed to show our appreciation simply for stopping by.”\\n\\nIf you step back, the “we like seeing you, regardless” is a nonsensical statement from a company. Starbucks as an entity has no feelings, and its shareholders want profits, which come in greater quantity from customers who buy more. And sure enough, in just a few years, the company realized it actually does like seeing customers more when they spend a lot.\\n\\nWith the “we like seeing you” framing, Starbucks fell into a trap that is common with loyalty programs: establishing not just an exchange relationship with its customers based on mutual benefit, but a communal relationship based on mutual caring and support. The norms surrounding communal relationships — the fiction that a company is your friend — can strengthen customers’ bonds with a company. But they also set up customers for disappointment.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nThat said, Starbucks has not been the only violator of communal norms in the Starbucks customer relationship. I have it on good authority that many Starbucks customers — including at least one Upshot editor — have been gaming the existing system by splitting their transactions: for example, being rung up once for a coffee and again for a muffin, in order to receive two stars when they might otherwise get just one.\\n\\nYou might say, hey, Starbucks is a big company, and there’s nothing in the My Starbucks Rewards terms and conditions that would seem to prohibit transaction-splitting. And that’s fair enough in an exchange relationship, but taking advantage of a technicality is probably not how you would treat a friend.\\n\\nIf customers are going to take a “hey, it’s just business” approach to their relationship with Starbucks, they should expect the company to do the same — and it has.\",\n",

Did the founders really intend to empower crazy people to kill children at school or worshipers in a church? If they did, then we should all have the right to portable nukes — for that is the logical conclusion of such an argument.\\n\\nNo, the Second Amendment became a cancer because lawmakers stopped making laws to match the technological advances of weaponry. They did it to appease a lobby of gunmakers. And that cowering to a single special interest shows how the cancer has spread to the democracy itself, making it nearly impossible for majority will to be exercised.\\n\\nA majority of Americans — indeed, a majority of gun owners — want laws to keep lunatics and terrorists from committing mass homicide.

As he told the N.R.A. after the election, “You came through big for me, and I am going to come through for you.”\\n\\nThe disgraced former cable pundit Bill O’Reilly said all the recent carnage is “the price of freedom.” But it’s not the price of freedom in Canada or Japan or England.

President Roosevelt signed the National Firearms Act of 1934, restricting sales of machine guns and sawed-off shotguns — the weapons of choice for violent gangsters.\\n\\nBut now we have more regulations on paint, toys and the pull date of milk than on sophisticated weapons. The Supreme Court, though it ruled 5-4 in the 2008 Heller case that an individual has the right to own a gun unconnected to service in a militia, has left the door open to sensible regulation.\\n\\n“Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited,” the court wrote in that case. “It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever for whatever purpose.”\\n\\nIt’s a no-brainer to pass a law designed to keep people from turning their AKs into machine guns with the so-called bump stocks. But it was also a no-brainer to restrict people on terrorism watch lists from buying guns, as was proposed after the Orlando slaughter of 49 people last year. It failed.

Cerca de una catedral del siglo XIII, en esta ciudad suiza a la orilla de un hermoso lago, encontré lo que estaba buscando: una imprenta de Gutenberg.\\n\\n“Eso fue el internet de sus tiempos —al menos tan influyente como el iPhone—”, dijo Gabriel de Montmollin, director del Museo Internacional de la Reforma, mientras jugaba con la réplica del gran invento de Johann Gutenberg. Antes de él, para elaborar un solo libro se necesitaban cuatro monjes trabajando arduamente hasta durante un año en su monasterio con plumas de ave y pergamino.\\n\\nCon el avance de los tipos móviles en la Europa del siglo XV, una imprenta podía producir 3000 páginas iguales en un día. En poco tiempo, la gente promedio empezó a poder viajar a sitios que le eran desconocidos gracias a los mapas. La información médica se trasmitía con más libertad y rapidez, lo que disminuyó la influencia de los charlatanes. Y se podía encontrar el camino hacia Dios, o el camino para dejar de creer en Dios, con acceso a pensamientos otrora prohibidos.\\n\\nLa imprenta plana ofreció la perspectiva de que los tiranos jamás podrían matar libros o suprimir ideas. La creación de Gutenberg rompió el monopolio que tenía el clero sobre la escritura. Y años más tarde, azuzados por panfletos salidos de una imprenta como aquella, las colonias de América se levantaron y dieron origen a sus naciones.\\n\\nAsí pues, planteemos una pregunta para este décimo aniversario del iPhone: ¿el dispositivo que quizá sea el más revolucionario de todos los tiempos nos ha dado una sola idea que sea magnífica? Casi todos los avances de la palabra escrita a través de la tecnología han significado también avances para la humanidad.\\n\\nClaro, podemos afirmar que el iPhone lo cambió todo. Al poner todo el conocimiento registrado del mundo en la palma de la mano, revolucionó el trabajo, las comidas, los viajes y la forma de socializar. Nos hizo más narcisistas –”¡Aquí estoy otra vez, haciendo cosas sensacionales!”– y desencadenó todo un ejército de horribles troles. Ya no tenemos la paciencia de sentarnos a ver un partido completo de cualquier deporte sin sacar el aparato del bolsillo. Y hay otra baja derivada de los más de mil millones de teléfonos que ha vendido Apple en estos diez años: la capacidad de soñar despiertos está en peligro de extinción.\\n\\nEmpero, pese a todo eso, yo sigo esperando a que el iPhone haga lo que hizo la imprenta por la religión y la democracia. Este año también se conmemoran los 500 años de que Martín Lutero publicara sus 95 tesis en contra de la corrupción de la Iglesia católica en Roma. El museo de Ginebra presenta convincentemente el argumento de que la imprenta abrió más mentes que cualquier otra cosa.\\n\\nLa exhibición del museo, “La imprenta, primeras páginas de una revolución”, cita a Lutero, quien dijo que la imprenta era “el más grande y extraordinario acto de la gracia divina”. Como monje católico renegado, Lutero jamás habría visto sus escritos salir del monasterio. Pero gracias a la máquina democratizadora de Gutenberg, de 1517 a 1520 circularon unos 300.000 ejemplares de las provocaciones de Lutero.\\n\\nIgualmente, es difícil imaginar la Revolución francesa o la Guerra de Independencia de Estados Unidos sin esas voces ilustradas por escrito.\\n\\nEn los albores de la palabra escrita, hará unos 5000 años, se garabateaban signos en arcilla. Los mensajes en ocasiones eran obscenos, la mayoría de las veces banales. Los griegos nos dejaron humor, tragedia y poesía. Los rollos de papiro eran portátiles; los comandantes romanos los llevaban consigo a modo de los actuales libros de bolsillo, metidos en sus alforjas.\\n\\nDe la naturaleza de las cosas, poema del filósofo romano Lucrecio del primer siglo de nuestra era, fue una de las cosas más “peligrosamente radicales” que se hayan escrito, como asegura Stephen Greenblatt en su libro The Swerve. Redescubierto y después impreso en las primeras fases del Renacimiento en la imprenta de Gutenberg, ese homenaje poético a la buena vida echó por tierra buena parte de la sombría mentalidad medieval de Europa.\\n\\nPodemos contar a la Carta Magna, uno de los documentos fundamentales en la evolución de las sociedades libres, y los Cuentos de Canterbury de Chaucer, que difundió el inglés coloquial, entre los puntos culminantes en los mil años en que se han producido libros, ya sea con las manos acalambradas de los escribas o impresos con los tipos móviles de madera.\\n\\nPoco después de que Steve Jobs presentara el iPhone, declaró que el libro encuadernado probablemente estaba destinado a acabar en el ático de la historia. No tan rápido. Después de un periodo de rápido crecimiento de los libros electrónicos, ha regresado algo más cercano al medio de los volúmenes de Chaucer.\\n\\nLa esperanza del iPhone, y de internet en general, era que liberaría a la gente de sociedades cerradas. Pero el fracaso de la Primavera Árabe y la constante represión de las ideas en Corea del Norte, China e Irán demuestran que eso no se ha confirmado. Y es más que patético que el líder del mundo libre aproveche su teléfono para insultar mujeres o enviar extraños videos donde aparece él mismo golpeando reporteros imaginarios.\\n\\nEl iPhone aún es joven. Ciertamente es “uno de los productos más importantes, exitosos y que más ha cambiado al mundo en la historia”, como dijo el director ejecutivo de Apple, Tim Cook. Pero no sabría decir si el mundo cambió para mejor con el iPhone –como fue el caso de la imprenta– o si simplemente cambió.',\n",

Throughout the world, every country but Russia (and to a small degree, Israel) has a lesser view of the United States under Trump.\\n\\nFor years at a time — make that decades — the home of the successor to St. Peter was a house of nasty intrigue, deceit and power put to awful use. Popes fathered wars, and children, had heretics executed or chained to a cell in the belly of Castel Sant’Angelo, the fortress that fronts Vatican City. The Vicar of Christ cut deals with dictators, including a devil’s bargain with Mussolini. With its institutional cover-up of pedophile clerics, the church showed the Mafia a thing or two about organized crime. In matters of sex, it was medieval and hypocritical. It was afraid of science.\\n\\nNow the pope uses science to shame Trump, who stares down a parade of hurricanes and says, nothing to see there. “Whoever denies it has to go to scientists and ask them,” said Francis last week. “They speak very clearly. Scientists are precise.” Can a statue of Galileo in St. Peter’s Square be far behind?\\n\\nOn Wednesday, a glorious Roman morning with a bite of fall in the air, the pope holds his general audience. The goofy smile is electric. He’s buoyant. The day before, Trump spoke to the United Nations, a tweet dressed up as a speech. He made a very real threat to wipe out a nation of 25 million people. He would, if he has to, “totally destroy North Korea.”\\n\\nThis has always been the implication of having more nukes than the other guy. But diplomacy — another word for Trump to look up — is the art of war by other means. Trump pushed America first, which sounded like “Me, me, me.” He played the petulance card, the grievance card.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nAs Trump went low, the pope went high. A few days earlier, Francis was asked about a Trump decision that could break up the families of 800,000 Dreamers in the United States. “If he is a good pro-life believer, he must understand that family is the cradle of life and one must defend its unity,” Francis answered.\\n\\nPeople who are hung up on doctrinal changes — angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin arguments over whether divorced Catholics can receive communion or not — are missing the big picture. Behold the Francis doctrine: an expansion of “pro-life” to include help for refugees, the poor, the powerless.\\n\\nTrump doesn’t get it. His nominee to the Vatican is Callista Gingrich, wife of Newt Gingrich. Newt, you must remember, carried on a six-year extramarital affair with her while impeaching a president for having an affair. Her appointment was something the Vatican of old would do — a cynical ploy. The Vatican of today can marvel at how quickly history pivots on a single person.\",\n",

Throughout the world, every country but Russia (and to a small degree, Israel) has a lesser view of the United States under Trump.\\n\\nFor years at a time — make that decades — the home of the successor to St. Peter was a house of nasty intrigue, deceit and power put to awful use. Popes fathered wars, and children, had heretics executed or chained to a cell in the belly of Castel Sant’Angelo, the fortress that fronts Vatican City. The Vicar of Christ cut deals with dictators, including a devil’s bargain with Mussolini. With its institutional cover-up of pedophile clerics, the church showed the Mafia a thing or two about organized crime. In matters of sex, it was medieval and hypocritical. It was afraid of science.\\n\\nNow the pope uses science to shame Trump, who stares down a parade of hurricanes and says, nothing to see there. “Whoever denies it has to go to scientists and ask them,” said Francis last week. “They speak very clearly. Scientists are precise.” Can a statue of Galileo in St. Peter’s Square be far behind?\\n\\nOn Wednesday, a glorious Roman morning with a bite of fall in the air, the pope holds his general audience. The goofy smile is electric. He’s buoyant. The day before, Trump spoke to the United Nations, a tweet dressed up as a speech. He made a very real threat to wipe out a nation of 25 million people. He would, if he has to, “totally destroy North Korea.”\\n\\nThis has always been the implication of having more nukes than the other guy. But diplomacy — another word for Trump to look up — is the art of war by other means. Trump pushed America first, which sounded like “Me, me, me.” He played the petulance card, the grievance card.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nAs Trump went low, the pope went high. A few days earlier, Francis was asked about a Trump decision that could break up the families of 800,000 Dreamers in the United States. “If he is a good pro-life believer, he must understand that family is the cradle of life and one must defend its unity,” Francis answered.\\n\\nPeople who are hung up on doctrinal changes — angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin arguments over whether divorced Catholics can receive communion or not — are missing the big picture. Behold the Francis doctrine: an expansion of “pro-life” to include help for refugees, the poor, the powerless.\\n\\nTrump doesn’t get it. His nominee to the Vatican is Callista Gingrich, wife of Newt Gingrich. Newt, you must remember, carried on a six-year extramarital affair with her while impeaching a president for having an affair. Her appointment was something the Vatican of old would do — a cynical ploy. The Vatican of today can marvel at how quickly history pivots on a single person.\",\n",

Did the founders really intend to empower crazy people to kill children at school or worshipers in a church? If they did, then we should all have the right to portable nukes — for that is the logical conclusion of such an argument.\\n\\nNo, the Second Amendment became a cancer because lawmakers stopped making laws to match the technological advances of weaponry. They did it to appease a lobby of gunmakers. And that cowering to a single special interest shows how the cancer has spread to the democracy itself, making it nearly impossible for majority will to be exercised.\\n\\nA majority of Americans — indeed, a majority of gun owners — want laws to keep lunatics and terrorists from committing mass homicide. But what is the response of our elected officials? I’ll let President Trump explain. As he told the N.R.A. after the election, “You came through big for me, and I am going to come through for you.”\\n\\nThe disgraced former cable pundit Bill O’Reilly said all the recent carnage is “the price of freedom.” But it’s not the price of freedom in Canada or Japan or England. It’s the price of freedom only in the United States, where mass killings have surged. In every other free country, sanity has prevailed.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nAnd what about that “well regulated militia” part of the amendment? It’s overlooked in favor of the second clause, about the right of people to firearms. Nearly half the states have no requirements, before buying a gun, for any kind of training in handling a firearm.\\n\\nAs I said, it’s only in the last 30 years or so that this amendment has metastasized. President Roosevelt signed the National Firearms Act of 1934, restricting sales of machine guns and sawed-off shotguns — the weapons of choice for violent gangsters.\\n\\nBut now we have more regulations on paint, toys and the pull date of milk than on sophisticated weapons. The Supreme Court, though it ruled 5-4 in the 2008 Heller case that an individual has the right to own a gun unconnected to service in a militia, has left the door open to sensible regulation.\\n\\n“Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited,” the court wrote in that case. “It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever for whatever purpose.”\\n\\nIt’s a no-brainer to pass a law designed to keep people from turning their AKs into machine guns with the so-called bump stocks. But it was also a no-brainer to restrict people on terrorism watch lists from buying guns, as was proposed after the Orlando slaughter of 49 people last year. It failed. A healthy democracy, reflecting the outrage of its citizens and the common-sense will of the majority, would have done right by the Orlando victims in a heartbeat.\\n\\nBut we’re no longer a healthy democracy, thanks to the cancer that has grown out of the Constitution.\",\n",

Cerca de una catedral del siglo XIII, en esta ciudad suiza a la orilla de un hermoso lago, encontré lo que estaba buscando: una imprenta de Gutenberg.\\n\\n“Eso fue el internet de sus tiempos —al menos tan influyente como el iPhone—”, dijo Gabriel de Montmollin, director del Museo Internacional de la Reforma, mientras jugaba con la réplica del gran invento de Johann Gutenberg. Antes de él, para elaborar un solo libro se necesitaban cuatro monjes trabajando arduamente hasta durante un año en su monasterio con plumas de ave y pergamino.\\n\\nCon el avance de los tipos móviles en la Europa del siglo XV, una imprenta podía producir 3000 páginas iguales en un día. En poco tiempo, la gente promedio empezó a poder viajar a sitios que le eran desconocidos gracias a los mapas. La información médica se trasmitía con más libertad y rapidez, lo que disminuyó la influencia de los charlatanes. Y se podía encontrar el camino hacia Dios, o el camino para dejar de creer en Dios, con acceso a pensamientos otrora prohibidos.\\n\\nLa imprenta plana ofreció la perspectiva de que los tiranos jamás podrían matar libros o suprimir ideas. La creación de Gutenberg rompió el monopolio que tenía el clero sobre la escritura. Y años más tarde, azuzados por panfletos salidos de una imprenta como aquella, las colonias de América se levantaron y dieron origen a sus naciones.\\n\\nAsí pues, planteemos una pregunta para este décimo aniversario del iPhone: ¿el dispositivo que quizá sea el más revolucionario de todos los tiempos nos ha dado una sola idea que sea magnífica? Casi todos los avances de la palabra escrita a través de la tecnología han significado también avances para la humanidad.\\n\\nClaro, podemos afirmar que el iPhone lo cambió todo. Al poner todo el conocimiento registrado del mundo en la palma de la mano, revolucionó el trabajo, las comidas, los viajes y la forma de socializar. Nos hizo más narcisistas –”¡Aquí estoy otra vez, haciendo cosas sensacionales!”– y desencadenó todo un ejército de horribles troles. Ya no tenemos la paciencia de sentarnos a ver un partido completo de cualquier deporte sin sacar el aparato del bolsillo. Y hay otra baja derivada de los más de mil millones de teléfonos que ha vendido Apple en estos diez años: la capacidad de soñar despiertos está en peligro de extinción.\\n\\nEmpero, pese a todo eso, yo sigo esperando a que el iPhone haga lo que hizo la imprenta por la religión y la democracia. Este año también se conmemoran los 500 años de que Martín Lutero publicara sus 95 tesis en contra de la corrupción de la Iglesia católica en Roma. El museo de Ginebra presenta convincentemente el argumento de que la imprenta abrió más mentes que cualquier otra cosa.\\n\\nLa exhibición del museo, “La imprenta, primeras páginas de una revolución”, cita a Lutero, quien dijo que la imprenta era “el más grande y extraordinario acto de la gracia divina”. Como monje católico renegado, Lutero jamás habría visto sus escritos salir del monasterio. Pero gracias a la máquina democratizadora de Gutenberg, de 1517 a 1520 circularon unos 300.000 ejemplares de las provocaciones de Lutero.\\n\\nIgualmente, es difícil imaginar la Revolución francesa o la Guerra de Independencia de Estados Unidos sin esas voces ilustradas por escrito.\\n\\nEn los albores de la palabra escrita, hará unos 5000 años, se garabateaban signos en arcilla. Los mensajes en ocasiones eran obscenos, la mayoría de las veces banales. Los griegos nos dejaron humor, tragedia y poesía. Los rollos de papiro eran portátiles; los comandantes romanos los llevaban consigo a modo de los actuales libros de bolsillo, metidos en sus alforjas.\\n\\nDe la naturaleza de las cosas, poema del filósofo romano Lucrecio del primer siglo de nuestra era, fue una de las cosas más “peligrosamente radicales” que se hayan escrito, como asegura Stephen Greenblatt en su libro The Swerve. Redescubierto y después impreso en las primeras fases del Renacimiento en la imprenta de Gutenberg, ese homenaje poético a la buena vida echó por tierra buena parte de la sombría mentalidad medieval de Europa.\\n\\nPodemos contar a la Carta Magna, uno de los documentos fundamentales en la evolución de las sociedades libres, y los Cuentos de Canterbury de Chaucer, que difundió el inglés coloquial, entre los puntos culminantes en los mil años en que se han producido libros, ya sea con las manos acalambradas de los escribas o impresos con los tipos móviles de madera.\\n\\nPoco después de que Steve Jobs presentara el iPhone, declaró que el libro encuadernado probablemente estaba destinado a acabar en el ático de la historia. No tan rápido. Después de un periodo de rápido crecimiento de los libros electrónicos, ha regresado algo más cercano al medio de los volúmenes de Chaucer.\\n\\nLa esperanza del iPhone, y de internet en general, era que liberaría a la gente de sociedades cerradas. Pero el fracaso de la Primavera Árabe y la constante represión de las ideas en Corea del Norte, China e Irán demuestran que eso no se ha confirmado. Y es más que patético que el líder del mundo libre aproveche su teléfono para insultar mujeres o enviar extraños videos donde aparece él mismo golpeando reporteros imaginarios.\\n\\nEl iPhone aún es joven. Ciertamente es “uno de los productos más importantes, exitosos y que más ha cambiado al mundo en la historia”, como dijo el director ejecutivo de Apple, Tim Cook. Pero no sabría decir si el mundo cambió para mejor con el iPhone –como fue el caso de la imprenta– o si simplemente cambió.',\n",

       "     'body': \"The White House and Pentagon are under increasing pressure to show that the United States is taking more concrete steps to combat the Islamic State. In a reflection of that pressure, Mr. Carter surprised several of his top aides by inserting the plan for the additional commandos into his prepared testimony the night before Tuesday’s hearing, even though it had not been fully developed.\\n\\n“It was his bright, shiny toy,” said one senior Pentagon official, noting it was the kind of initiative President Obama has demanded from his national security team.\\n\\nNow military planners at the Joint Special Operations Command headquarters at Fort Bragg, N.C., and in Washington are scrambling to catch up with their boss’s unexpected announcement, and fill in details of the bare-bones proposal, such as what happens to any detainees American commandos seize in the raids.\\n\\nFor Mr. Obama, who has been loath to send more troops to the region after more than a decade of war, the insertion of the commandos represents an effort to intensify the war effort without committing a large American fighting force like, say, a division of ground combat troops. Defense officials said the new special operators would work with Kurdish and Iraqi troops in Iraq, and possibly Syrian and Arab troops during targeted raids in Syria.\\n\\nSo the administration is taking smaller steps to increase pressure on the Islamic State without fundamentally appearing to alter its cautious strategy.\\n\\n“The president is trying to find the balance between being all in, with a large deployment of ground forces, and being not in,” said Aaron David Miller, a vice president with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\\n\\nMr. Obama has so far sent 3,500 American forces to Iraq since the Islamic State took a huge amount of land and declared a caliphate.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nColonel Warren and other Defense Department officials declined to detail how the commandos would operate, saying that they do not want to compromise American capabilities. But they held up the example of a commando raid in May that resulted in the killing of a midlevel Islamic State leader and the capture of his wife as an example of what is to come.\\n\\nOn May 16, around two dozen Delta Force commandos entered Syria aboard Black Hawk helicopters and V-22 Ospreys from Iraq and killed Abu Sayyaf, whom American officials described as the Islamic State’s “emir of oil and gas.”\\n\\nThe wife of Abu Sayyaf, Umm Sayyaf, was captured and taken to Iraq, American officials said, where she was questioned and detained at a military facility. They said the American forces were able to seize laptop computers, cellphones and other materials from the site.\\n\\nBut the case has raised the question of what will be done with Islamic State leaders who are captured alive. Had Abu Sayyaf been detained, officials said at the time, the plan was to interrogate him in Iraq and then send him to the United States for criminal prosecution.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said the fates of prisoners would be decided case by case.\\n\\nThe new deployment of commandos to Iraq “feels like precisely that JSOC type of strategy” that the Bush administration employed during the Iraq surge, said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\\n\\n“The difference is, when we had the surge, we had a much clearer strategy for how we were going to defeat Al Qaeda in Anbar,” Mr. Goldenberg said, referring to the Sunni Awakening, in which Sunni tribesmen agreed to work with American troops in their villages and towns.\\n\\nBut today many of those Sunni tribesmen say that they were betrayed and squeezed out of power by the Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. Whether they will be willing to sign on to the same strategy again, Mr. Goldenberg said, is a big question.\\n\\nSome Defense Department officials expressed concern about the ad hoc nature of the commando plan and its announcement, noting that the 50 Special Operations forces that Mr. Obama ordered to eastern Syria a month ago to train and advise Syria opposition fighters still have not arrived.\",\n",

The main target was computer materials inside the house that could contain clues about future terrorist plots.\\n\\nIn a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump called the raid “successful” and said that it had captured “important intelligence that will assist the U.S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world.” He also lamented the loss of the American service member “in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism.”\\n\\nThe military’s Central Command said in an earlier statement on Sunday that “similar operations have produced intelligence on Al Qaeda logistics, recruiting and financing efforts.” In previous raids in Iraq, Syria and Somalia, commandos have recovered laptop computers, thumb drives and cellphones that yielded important information about militant leaders’ locations, activities and associates.\\n\\nA United States military aircraft helping with the operation experienced a “hard landing” near the site of the raid, resulting in injuries to two other service members, military officials said. That aircraft, identified by a senior American official as an Osprey that was evacuating the troops wounded in the firefight, was unable to fly after the landing and was deliberately destroyed by American airstrikes. The wounded troops and the Osprey’s crew were lifted to safety by another American aircraft.\\n\\nAmerican officials and analysts said the Qaeda leader who was believed to have been killed was Abdulrauf al Dhahab.\\n\\nThe raid took place in Yemen around the time that Mr. Trump was signing a directive in Washington on Saturday afternoon ordering Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to devise within 30 days a more aggressive plan to defeat the Islamic State.\\n\\nThe Islamic State was born from Al Qaeda’s branch in Iraq, but the two terrorist organizations are now sworn rivals not only in Iraq and Syria, but also in other hot spots like Yemen and Afghanistan, where both groups have affiliates.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nBecause Mr. Trump had been explicit about his intention to ask for the review to accelerate the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, American military planners had begun drafting classified options to present to the new commander in chief. Some of those options, like pushing more authority to conduct strikes to commanders in the field or loosening restrictions designed to limit the risk to civilians, could also be applied to attacks against Qaeda fighters and Islamic State insurgents.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Central Command’s statement did not elaborate on details of the raid or identify the commando who was killed.\\n\\nA local resident who witnessed the raid, speaking by phone, said he had seen warplanes bombing several houses in the village around 2 a.m. Sunday. The man said he had seen at least three buildings being struck before he fled. He did not want to be identified because he feared that speaking out would endanger his life.\\n\\nA Yemeni government official in Bayda Province said the targeted buildings belonged to the Dhahab family, which is known for its ties to Al Qaeda. Two male members of the family have been killed in drone strikes over the past two years.\\n\\nThe Yemeni official said that at least eight women and seven children, ages 3 to 13, had been killed in the raid. Qaeda supporters said that Mr. Awlaki’s young daughter was among the dead and denied that any senior Qaeda leaders had been killed, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist communications.\\n\\nFaisal Mohamed, a Bayda official whose two sons witnessed the attack, said it severely damaged a school, a health facility and a mosque.\\n\\n“I was on the way back to town when they called and said that there were Americans everywhere, so I knew I should not go,” Mr. Mohamed said by phone from nearby Marib Province. “My kids told me that the sky was crowded with helicopters and that they saw people jumping out of planes.”\\n\\n“The last thing they said to me was that the whole town is devastated now,” Mr. Mohamed said.\\n\\nJust over a week ago, United States drone strikes killed three other men suspected of being Qaeda operatives in Bayda Province, the first such killings reported in the country since Mr. Trump assumed the presidency.\\n\\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group’s branch in Yemen, has long been seen by American intelligence and counterterrorism officials as among the most dangerous branches of the global terrorist network, and the one posing the most immediate threat to United States territory. The group’s leaders have sought in at least three cases to detonate bombs hidden aboard American commercial jetliners. All of those plots were thwarted.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nThe raid on Saturday night was the latest in a series of Special Operations drone strikes and ground attacks in Yemen in recent years.\\n\\nIn November 2014, helicopter-borne Special Operations commandos and Yemeni troops rescued eight hostages being held in a remote part of eastern Yemen by Al Qaeda’s affiliate there. After landing, the commandos hiked some distance in the dark to a mountainside cave, where they surprised the militants holding the captives.\\n\\nA month later, in December 2014, United States commandos stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. But the raid ended in tragedy, with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him.\",\n",

The choice of those bosses, in turn, is shaped by concentric circles of influence that include union leaders, members of Congress, the mayor and ethnic politicking.\\n\\nFour years ago, Mr. de Blasio threw his weight behind Ms. Mark-Viverito, in part because she was a Latina, according to two advisers involved in the decision.

Everyone laughed. Then the parade of first-ness marched on.\\n\\nCouncilman Ydanis Rodriguez of Manhattan, an immigrant born in the Dominican Republic, said, “I want to be the speaker with the accent.” Mr. Cornegy, who is black, opened with the fact that he is a father of six. Mr. Johnson highlighted that he is not only gay but H.I.V. positive. (It went unmentioned on stage, but Mr. Johnson’s grandmother was Korean.)\\n\\nMr. Levine, the only straight white man of the eight, joked he was the only left-handed person on stage: “I believe that should be a qualification!”\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nIn an interview, and in private conversations with his colleagues, Mr. Levine has emphasized that he represents a district “that is overwhelmingly Latino and African-American” in Upper Manhattan, and that he lives in a “Spanish-speaking home, and my kids learned English not until they went to school.”\\n\\n“If I don’t win, I don’t think it will be because of my race. And if one of the candidates of color does win, I don’t think it will be because of their race,” he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nMr. Rodriguez said his Latino heritage was central to his candidacy. Unless a Latino is selected as speaker, he said, when Ms. Mark-Viverito departs, “there’s not going to be another voice of the second-largest community in our city” in any citywide post.\\n\\nAmong the other complexities is the ongoing leadership tussle in Albany.\\n\\nThere, the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie of the Bronx, is African-American, but the Senate Democratic leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, an African-American woman from Westchester, has been denied the post of majority leader in large part because a breakaway faction of Democrats has sided with Republicans. Race has been a dynamic in that fight.\\n\\n“Let me just say, we have always had white men in power,” Letitia James, New York City’s public advocate and only black citywide official, said at a rally in Harlem for Ms. Stewart-Cousins over the summer.\\n\\nThat argument, made with a bit more subtlety, may not prove decisive, but it has fundamentally shaped the landscape of the speaker’s race. “Race is the central challenge of American life, so it’s inevitably in the background of American politics,” Mr. Torres said.\\n\\nAdded Mr. Richards, “There’s no doubt that identity politics does play out in politics.”\",\n",

So these kind of restrictions that did not allow us to employ the air power fully have been removed, yes.”\\n\\nHe made similar remarks testifying that afternoon in front of the House Armed Services Committee.\\n\\nThe changes are similar to the rules of engagement governing the fight against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq as well as in eastern Afghanistan, where the extremist group has been active for the past two years.\\n\\nThey also hark back to the height of the war in Afghanistan, when about 100,000 American troops were fanned out across the country and intelligence was regularly harvested in an effort to produce more targets for fleets of American aircraft and hundreds of Special Operations forces.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nDavid W. Barno, a retired Army lieutenant general, who led the war effort in Afghanistan for almost two years, said the changes probably indicate that the American military is shifting from a largely defensive war and “getting off its hands and much more involved in combat operations.”\\n\\nIndeed, Mr. Mattis’s push to implement more aggressive rules of engagement coincides with his decision to place American troops closer to the fighting, which he stresses will be in only an advisory role. It is also the latest move in a string of military decisions by the Trump administration to give more decision-making authority to troops at lower levels.\\n\\nMr. Mattis’s comments also provided some clarity about a remark made last month by President Trump in front of the United Nations General Assembly. During a speech, Mr. Trump said that he had “totally changed” the rules of engagement against the Taliban and terrorist groups in Afghanistan as part of his new strategy for South Asia.\\n\\nAn American military official in Afghanistan said that Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the top American commander in the country, had requested the new rules, and that they were expected to be in effect soon. But the official acknowledged that changes were still being worked out. He said that Mr. Mattis chose an unconventional venue to describe them and added that they are usually never discussed.\\n\\n“One of the things that is interesting to me is why this didn’t go into a closed hearing,” Mr. Barno said of Mr. Mattis’s decision to talk about the rules of engagement. “It’s a bit odd to me they didn’t go down that route to paint the picture more clearly.”\\n\\nLater during the hearing, Mr. Mattis was pressed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, about another issue: whether he would be “honest with the American people about the numbers of troops you are sending over and what their missions will be.”\\n\\nMr. Mattis replied, “No, ma’am, if it involves telling the enemy something that will help them.”\",\n",

The company has signed up almost 24 million paying international subscribers, or roughly one-third of its total users, according to regulatory filings.\\n\\nYet Netflix and its efforts to expand overseas are facing a series of challenges that could hamper future growth, including patchwork regulatory restrictions worldwide and stiff competition in individual countries from services that are attracting viewers like Mr. Díez Ferreira.\\n\\nThat is particularly true in the European Union, where current rules often limit what content can be made available in each of the region’s 28 countries. National audiences, many of whom are not fluent in English, often prefer local-language programming, and potential subscribers remain hesitant to pay for premium content.\\n\\n“We had expectations for Netflix to be doing slightly better, but the broadcasting landscape is very locally oriented,” David Sidebottom, an analyst at Futuresource Consultancy, said in reference to Netflix’s international reach. “People are also more reluctant to pay for a monthly subscription to a video service in France and Germany.”\\n\\nIn many countries, Netflix faces an uphill challenge. Well-established rivals have sprouted from France to India, often mimicking Netflix’s video-on-demand services while promoting local-language content for national audiences. Other media companies like Sky of Britain and Mediaset of Italy also have struck licensing deals with media companies like HBO to offer American programming for Europeans who crave the latest American shows.\\n\\nAnd a number of deep-pocketed global tech companies like Amazon and Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce giant, as well as a flurry of new start-ups, now offer Netflix-like services, which could make it harder for the company to gain a foothold in new territories.\\n\\n“Every market is growing,” Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said recently when asked by investors about the company’s aggressive international expansion plans. “But some are doing better than others,” he acknowledged. “That’s up to us to manage to get the total portfolio to be as fast growing as they are.” Netflix does not provide specific figures on individual countries worldwide.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nPeople across the globe are taking advantage of new technological trends, including ultrafast broadband and affordable smartphones, to stream movies and television programs to their homes and, increasingly, to watch shows on the go.\\n\\nNetflix, for instance, could roughly double its subscribers worldwide, to 130 million by the end of the decade, with the majority of viewers living outside the United States, according to Ampere Analysis, an independent video analytics firm. That figure would be about triple that of Amazon, its closest rival.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Currently, content deals are made on a regional or national level.\\n\\nAnd in a bid to win over skeptical international customers, many of whom have never heard of Netflix, the company has teamed up with national cellphone and cable operators to offer the video-streaming service as part of existing video-on-demand offerings. The company has similar agreements with companies like Cablevision and Dish Network in the United States.\\n\\n“Offering Netflix gives our customers another reason to stay with us,” Marco Patuano, chief executive of Telecom Italia, said in an interview.\\n\\nTelecom Italia, a former Italian telecom monopoly, will allow people to pay for the video-streaming service through their monthly contracts when it becomes available in Italy on Thursday. “We want to give our customers as much premium content as we can,” Mr. Patuano said.\\n\\nFor Netflix to succeed globally, though, the company must outmuscle people like Jacinto Roca.\\n\\nAs the Spanish chief executive of Wuaki.tv, a Pan-European video-on-demand service owned by Rakuten, Mr. Roca already has 2.5 million subscribers spread across seven European countries, and plans to expand into three more markets by the end of 2015. In Spain, its main market, the company already is viewed as an incumbent, even before Netflix starts its rival service this week.\\n\\nWhile American programs represent roughly half of Wuaki.tv’s stable of content, the company, based in Barcelona, also employs small five-person teams in each country where it operates. Their mission is to buy local-language content to match users’ tastes (the company offers both monthly subscriptions and one-time purchases). That local flavor, Mr. Roca says, sets his company apart from Netflix’s mostly American programs.\\n\\n“Europeans want to watch European content,” he said in an interview. “We have the local knowledge of what people want. You can’t beat that.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nIn response, Netflix has started to produce its own non-English-language content, including “Narcos,” the series mostly in Spanish about the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar. Crime dramas in Italian and French are also planned.\\n\\nThe difficulties — and potential rewards — of Netflix’s expansion efforts are most evident in France, one of Europe’s largest media markets.\\n\\nWhen the company started its service there last year, local policy makers fretted that the American company would bombard subscribers with English-language content. The company also was criticized for flouting French rules that forced national television channels and other streaming services to subsidize French films. (The country’s regulators eventually extended the levy to include international companies with French customers.)\\n\\nA year after its introduction, though, Netflix’s service has attracted only 700,000 monthly subscribers, according to industry estimates, primarily by offering English-language content. That puts it slightly behind CanalPlay, a local streaming rival owned by Vivendi, a French media conglomerate. And Molotov, a Paris-based start-up run by several former prominent media executives, also has teamed up with 80 French and international television channels to offer video-on-demand services on a single online platform.\\n\\nFor Manuel Alduy, who runs CanalPlay, the arrival of Netflix has not proved to be the downfall of its local rivals. Instead, he says, the ability of French competitors to offer local content has won support of people who do not solely want to watch American movies or television shows.\\n\\n“We are a platform that fits with the tastes of a French audience,” said Mr. Alduy. Netflix, he said, “will find a seat in France. But it won’t be the upheaval as people thought it would be.”\",\n",
