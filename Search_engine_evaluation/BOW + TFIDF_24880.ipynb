This is , carved in relief or painted onto the slab.\\n\\nStelae were also used as territorial markers, as the boundary stelae of Akhenaten at Amarna, or to commemorate military victories. They were widely used in the Mesopotamia, Greece, Egypt, Ethiopia, and, quite independently, in China and some Buddhist cultures, and, more surely independently, by Mesoamerican civilisations, especially the Olmec and Maya. The huge number of stelae that survive from ancient Egypt and in Central America are one of the largest and most significant sources of information on those civilisations. \\n\\nUnfinished standing stones, set up without inscriptions from Libya in North Africa to Scotland were monuments of pre-literate Megalithic cultures in the Late Stone Age.\\n\\nAn obelisk is a specialized kind of stele. The Celtic high crosses of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales are \"specialized stelae\". Likewise, the totem pole of North and South America is a type of stelae. Gravestones are also kinds of stelae.\\n\\nIn 2004 the architect Peter Eisenman created a field of some 2,700 blank stelae, the \"Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe\" in Berlin to memory of the Holocaust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Martim Mércio da Silveira\\n\\nMartim Mércio da Silveira (1911 - 1972) is a former Brazilian football player. He has played for Brazil national team.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Pig in a poke\\n\\nPig in a poke is an English idiom which means a kind of deceptive trick. It is a blind bargain.\\n\\nThe phrase is about something which is offered for sale in a manner which hides its true value. The idiom means a purchase which turns out not to be what the seller claimed it was.\\n\\nThe term was first used in the Middle Ages. At this time, it was common to sell meat or small animals in cloth bags or sacks called a \"poke\". \\n\\nSometimes people simply bought the \"poke\" without looking inside; and sometimes people who thought they were buying pork or a small pig were surprised to find they had been sold something else.\\n\\nThe idiom \"pig in a poke\" is about what happens when someone does not look to see what is being bought or sold.\\n\\nThe idiom \"pig in a poke\" is used to describe something which is purchased without the buyer being aware of its true nature or value. \\n\\nThe phrase can also be applied to accepting an idea or plan without a full understanding of it. In other words, it is about starting a course of action without knowing the relevant facts.\\n\\nMany other European languages have a version of this phrase, but many are translated as a warning not to buy a cat in a bag. -\\n\\n\\n', 'Joseon\\n\\nJoseon (; ; July 1392 – October 1897) (also Chosŏn, Choson, Chosun, Cho-sen), was a Korean state started by Taejo Yi Seong-gye. It began after the end of the Goryeo Dynasty at what is today the city of Kaesong. Joseon was the last dynasty of Korean history and the longest Confucian dynasty.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n', 'South Hill, Virginia\\n\\nSouth Hill, Virginia is a town of Virginia in the United States.\\n\\n\\n', 'Fyodor Tyutchev\\n\\nFyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev (rus: \"Фёдор Иванович Тютчев\", fyô\\'dər ēvä\\'nəvĭch tyū\\'chĭf) (December 5 1803 – July 27, 1873) was one of the most significant Russian poets. Almost 20 years of his life he spent in Munich and Turin. Tyutchev was a good friend of Heinrich Heine, knew Schelling as well. Tyutchev didn’t want people to know him as a poet. He didn’t take any part in a literary life.\\n\\nWe know about 400 of his poems. Russian people quote them very often. His early poems are made in Russian poetic tradition of the XVIII century. In the 1830s we can find an influence of European (especially German) romanticism on Tyutchev’s lyrics. He writes philosophic poems about the universe, nature and human being. In 1840s Tyutchev wrote several articles about relations between Russia and Occidental civilization. In 1850s Tyutchev created several heartfelt poems, in which we can see love as a tragedy. These poems are combined into one cycle, named “Denisievsky”. “Denisievsky” means dedicated to a mistress of Tyutchev – Elena Alexandrovna Denisieva. In 1860s–1870s Tyutchev wrote mainly political poems.\\n\\nThe most famous Tyutchev\\'s poem is “Silentium!”. This is a hard appeal to be silent. Because a man never can understand another person. A line “A word once uttered is untrue” is one of the most popular aphorisms of Tyutchev. As well as “We can’t understand Russia by the reason” and “We are not know, what will be the respond for our word”. \\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Amasya\\n\\nAmasya is a city in northern Turkey.

It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop at his home in New South Wales, Australia. \\n\\nNGC 5128 is either a Hubble type lenticular galaxy or a elliptical galaxy. It is 1016 million light-years away.\\n\\nNGC 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth. Its active center has been well studied. The galaxy is the fifth brightest in the sky, and is an ideal amateur astronomy target. The galaxy is only visible from low northern latitudes and the southern hemisphere.\\n\\nSpitzer Space Telescope studies have confirmed that Centaurus A is colliding with, and devouring, a smaller spiral galaxy. Like other starburst galaxies, the collision produced the intense burst of star formation. \\n\\nThe center of the galaxy has a supermassive black hole. Its mass is about 55 million solar masses. This ejects a relativistic jet with emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. Astronomers have taken radio observations of the jet ten years apart. They found that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about half the speed of light. X-rays are produced further out as the jet collides with surrounding gas. This produces highly energetic particles. The radio jets of Centaurus A are over a million light years long.\\n\\n\\n', 'Arrondissement of Toul\\n\\nThe arrondissement of Toul is an arrondissement of France, in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department, Grand Est region.

Only buildings with continuously occupiable floors are included, thus non-building structures, including towers, are not included. (See List of tallest buildings and structures.)\\n\\nAs of 2016, this list includes all 135 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out) which reach a height of 300 metres (984\\xa0ft) or more as assessed by their highest architectural feature. Seven of the last eight buildings to have held the record as 'tallest building' are still found in the list, with the exception being the North Tower of the original World Trade Center after its destruction in the September 11 attacks of 2001.\\n\\nThe countries with three or more entries in the above list of 135 buildings are:\\n\\nThe count for China includes six in Hong Kong and, with the exception of a dozen buildings, all are relatively new, having been completed in and after 2010. Worldwide, as there are plans in the next five years for more than 80 buildings in the same height range (including about 40 in China), then the list should have a total of about 200 buildings by the year 2020.\\n\\nThis measurement disregards distinctions between architectural and non-architectural extensions, and simply measures to the highest point. This measurement is useful for air traffic obstacle determinations, and is also a wholly objective measure. However, this measurement includes extensions that are easily added, removed, and modified from a building and are independent of the overall structure.\\n\\nThis measurement only recently came into use, when the Petronas Towers passed the Sears Tower (now called Willis Tower) in height. The former was considered taller because its spires were considered architectural, while the latter's antennae were not. This led to the split of definitions, with the Sears Tower claiming the lead in this and the height-to-roof (now highest occupied floor) categories, and with the Petronas claiming the lead in the architectural height category.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'The Middle\\n\\n\"The Middle\" is a 2001 song released by Jimmy Eat World from their album, \"Bleed American\". It is the third song from their album.\\n\\nThe song is not what is usually heard from the band. It is one of the more straightforward, upbeat songs, its also one of their most well-known singles.\\n\\nThe band are featured in this music video. It also shows girls in their bikinis and a swimming pool, and someone goes into it during the guitar solo so for a moment its kinda faded out, but then he goes back to the surface. At the start of this video, two people in a car get out and go inside to the party.\\n\\n\\n', 'Fire ant\\n\\nFire ants are stinging ants. They are also called \"ginger ants\" and \"tropical fire ants\". They evolved in South America, but have become a major pest in North America. They are known for a painful sting. This sting uses a base not an acid.\\n\\nIn 1918, fire ants were accidentally moved into the United States of America by a ship from South America. They were moved in large amounts of dirt. The ships brought heavy things like machines from the US to South America. They brought back light things like crops. The dirt was used to make the ships weigh more. The dirt sometimes had fire ants in it.\\nIn the United States, fire ants have no natural predators or competitors. Native animals are not adapted to these ants. Fire ants are very aggressive. Their colonies can have many queens unlike many other ant species. Because of this, fire ants have spread very fast. By 1965, fire ant came up on the south eastern coast and as far west as Texas. Today they are found in at least 10 southern states. There is a separate group of fire ants living in California.\\n\\nFire ants have done a lot of harm as they have spread across the United States. Because they are attracted to electrical currents, they chew through wires. This makes shorts in electrical . Fire ants have also disturbed the natural balance of native ecosystems. In some places, they have killed off 70% of the native ant species and 40% of other native insect species.\\n\\nEach year, about 25,000 people go for medical help because of painful bites from fire ants. Fire ants attack in groups when disturbed. People often get many bites. Fire ant bites are usually not dangerous. Some people are allergic to fire ants. They may go into shock. This is called anaphylaxis. This can kill them.\\n\\nThe fire ants are growing in the US 80 years after they came there. About 157 chemicals, like ammonia, gasoline, parts of manure, and insect-killing pesticides, are used against fire ants. However, none of them were very helpful. By 1995, the government had allowed only one fire-ant bait for people to use a lot.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'James Hilton\\n\\nJames Hilton (9 September 1900 – 20 December 1954) was an English writer. He wrote several best-selling novels including \"Lost Horizon\" and \"Goodbye Mr. Chips\". \"Lost Horizon\" introduced an imaginary place called Shangri-La and made it popular.\\n\\nJames Hilton was born in Leigh. His father, John Hilton, was the headmaster of Chapel End School in Walthamstow. James Hilton partially based the character Mr. Chipping in \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" on his father.\\n\\nHilton wrote his two most famous books while living in an ordinary semi-detached house on Oak Hill Gardens, Woodford Green. The house is still there, and a small, blue sign says it was Hilton\\'s home.\\n\\nHe was married twice, first to Alice Brown and later to Galina Kopineck. Both marriages ended in divorce. He died in Long Beach, California from liver cancer.\\n\\nHilton became a success writer when he was still young. He published his first novel, \"Catherine Herself,\" when he was 20 years old. Several of his books were international bestsellers. Some successful films were made based on his novels. Three of the best known movies are: \"Lost Horizon\" (1933), \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" (1934), and \"Random Harvest\" (1941). Many copies of \"Lost Horizon\" were sold in the 1930s as one of the first Pocket Books. The serial number was \"1\". Some people call it the novel that began the popularity of paperback books.\\n\\n\"Lost Horizon\" is supposedly set in Tibet, and especially in a secret, imaginary valley called Shangri-La. Shangri-La now means any perfect, pleasurable place or utopia.\\n\\nIt is unsure exactly where and how Hilton got his ideas about Tibet. He may have been inspired to write \"Lost Horizon\" and to invent Shangri-La\" by reading the \"National Geographic Magazine\" by Joseph Rock. Rock was an Austrian-American botanist and ethnologist who explored southwestern China and areas near Tibet. Hilton have also read articles by early travelers in Tibet that he found in the British Library for more ideas Christian Zeeman may also have been the model for the hero of the story. He disappeared while living in Japan and there were rumors that he was living secretly in a Zen Buddhist monastery. Some say that the isolated valley town of Weaverville, California, in far northern Trinity County, was Shangri-La. However, this is a misunderstanding of a comment by Hilton in a 1941 interview. In that interview, Hilton said that Weaverville reminded him of Shangri-La. Coincidentally, Junction City (about 8 miles from Weaverville) now has a Tibetan Buddhist centre with the occasional Tibetan monks in saffron robes.\\n\\nAfter the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt told the press that the airplanes had taken off from Shangri-La. This was a kind of joke to hide the secret that they had taken off from aircraft carriers. Later, the US Navy gave that name to an aircraft carrier, and Roosevelt named his Maryland presidential retreat \"Shangri-La\". (That retreat is now called Camp David since President Dwight D. Eisenhower renamed it after his grandson.) Zhongdian is a mountain region of Southwest China that has now been renamed Shangri-La (Xianggelila) because it may have inspired Hilton\\'s book \\n\\nHilton lived and worked in Hollywood beginning in the mid-1930s. He won an Academy Award in 1942 for his work on the screenplay of \"Mrs. Miniver\". That film was based on the novel by Jan Struther. Hilton was the host of \"The Hallmark Playhouse\" (1948–1953) for CBS Radio. One of his later novels, \"Morning Journey\", was about the movie business.\\n\\n\\nSome of Hilton\\'s novels became films:\\n\\nHilton co-wrote the book and lyrics for \"Shangri-La\", an unsuccessful 1956 Broadway musical adaptation of \"Lost Horizon\".\\n\\n\\n\\n', '1950 FIFA World Cup\\n\\nThe 1950 FIFA World Cup was a football sporting event that was held in Brazil in 1950. \\nThis competition was special compared to other FIFA World Cup tournaments as the winner was decided by winning a mini-league instead of a knock-out game. Uruguay won the trophy after finishing higher than Brazil, Sweden and Spain in the final group stage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Caldwell County, North Carolina\\n\\nCaldwell County is a county in the state of North Carolina.

Often the Netherlands is called Holland, but this is only part of the Netherlands. The Dutch culture and ethnicity are also found outside of the Netherlands, with large number of Dutch living in the United States of America, South Africa, Suriname, Namibia.\\n\\nMany inventors were Dutch, including Hans Lippershey, Hans Janssen, and his son Zacharias Janssen the inventors of the microscope and the telescope, and the incubator. Many famous painters have also been Dutch, among them Rembrandt van Rijn, Vincent van Gogh and Johannes Vermeer.\\n\\nThe definition of ethnicity is not always clear. One can count all people living the Netherlands as Dutch, but many are not. This is because many people who live in The Netherlands were not born there. There are about 15.5 million people in the Netherlands who actually have the Dutch nationality. About 1 million people living in the Netherlands do not have the Dutch nationality. To make things more confusing, people who live in the other parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (including Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and the Caribbean Netherlands) also have Dutch nationality. Still, even more people in the Netherlands were not born there can also be called \"Dutch\". According to some definitions, also people who were born in the Netherlands, but who\\'s parents were not, cannot be called Dutch. This definition leaves almost 20% of the entire Dutch population to be \\'foreign\\'.\\n\\nThroughout the world there are about 30 million Dutch people:\\n\\nDuring the last 150 years, the Netherlands saw a relatively quick population growth as compared to the rest of Europe. For comparison: The Belgian population grew from 50% more inhabitants in 1850 to a third less in 2000. The population of the Netherlands grew from 3 million in 1850, to 5 million in 1900, to 10 million in 1950, to 16 million in 2000.\\n\\nThe Dutch society in the present can be seen as a very multicultural society. About 20% of the entire Dutch population is not of Dutch origin (these people are called \"allochtoon\" in Dutch). Even most members of the Dutch Royal family are allochtoon. This comes from the fact that the Netherlands were open to other nationalities and other religions since the beginning of the Republic of the Netherlands (in 1588). In the 17th century, it was not odd, for instance for Muslims to live in Amsterdam. After the Second World War, the Dutch hired many workers from Turkey and Morocco to rebuild the Netherlands. Many of these guest workers (\"gastarbeiders\") stayed in the Netherlands. Therefore, The Netherlands have a large Turkish and Moroccan community. Immigration from especially Suriname and Indonesia also led to the multi-cultural society of the present. Recent events (like the murder of Theo van Gogh by a radical Muslim) have led to negative views on \"allochtonen\" by some of the Dutch people.\\n\\nThe Dutch society is also famous for its liberal views. The Netherlands were the first country to legalize same-sex marriage (the marriage of homosexuals). The Netherlands have a strong gay-rights movement. Abortion and euthanasia are also legal in the Netherlands. The Netherlands are also the only country in the world where marijuana is \"gedoogd\". This means it is not legal but the laws against it are not actively enforced. \\n\\nThe Netherlands are one of the busiest countries in the world. Almost 16.5 million people live in the little country. That\\'s why not many Dutch live in villages. Most Dutch people live in cities, with a city being a place with at least 25,000 people living there. 8.7 million Dutch live in \"agglomerations\" (urban areas which are connected to each other, a sort of metropolitan area). That\\'s about 54% of all the Dutch people. About 15% of the Dutch people live in city\\'s which are not in an agglomeration. The other 30% live in villages (places with less than 25,000 people).\\n\\nThe Netherlands are a country where bicycles are used very much. Almost 30% of all travel is done by bicycle in the Netherlands. Bicycles are used so much so that throughout the Netherlands hundreds of bicycle parking lots (\"fietsenstallingen\") are built. In Amsterdam, there is even a 3-story high bicycle parking lot. Trains are also used very much (unlike in, for instance, the US). The biggest railway company (NS) has 1.1 million travellers per day. That\\'s 7 percent of the entire Dutch population each day.\\n\\n\\n', 'Anatinae\\n\\nThe Anatinae is a subfamily of the family Anatidae that including swans, geese and ducks.\\n\\nThey are the dabbling ducks. They feed mainly at the surface rather than by diving. The subfamily contains only the dabbling ducks and one relative, the extinct moa-nalos, land ducks which lived on some Hawaiian islands.\\n\\n\\n', 'Mass versus weight\\n\\nIn the physical sciences, mass and weight are different. The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in the object. Weight is a measure of the force on the object caused by a gravitational field. In other words, weight is how hard gravity pulls on an object. This means the mass of an object will remain at wherever it is on the earth\\'s surface, but if it is moved from the equator to the North Pole, its weight will grow by 0.5% because of the increase in the earth\\'s gravitational field.\\n\\nMass is measured in kilograms or pounds. A one-liter volume of water has a mass of one kilogram. Weight is measured in newtons, the standard unit for force. A one-kilogram mass placed on a bench presses down on the bench with almost ten newtons of force. \\n\\nThe weight of something is the value measured at the Earth\\'s surface. Unfortunately the common terms used to describe the weight of an object are units of mass such as kilograms or pounds. For almost all of human history weight has been measured on the surface of the Earth. Here, the weight is proportional to the mass. Objects which have the same mass have the same weight. An object with the twice the mass of another will also have twice the weight. As a consequence it is common practice to use the two words, mass and weight, as if they mean the same thing, and to use kilograms or pounds as the units for both mass and weight. Using the same terms to describe and measure the two different properties has led to confusion between these two properties, mass and weight. Mass and weight are not the same thing.\\n\\nGenerally, mass refers to how \"heavy\" something is. However, mass is really an \"inertial\" property; that is, the tendency of an object to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force. According to Newton\\'s second law of motion, as expressed in the formula an object with a mass, \"m\", of one kilogram will accelerate, \"a\", at one meter per second per second (about one-tenth the acceleration due to Earth\\'s gravity) when acted upon by a force, \"F\", of one newton.\\n\\nIt is possible to feel the difference between weight and mass by suspending an object with a mass of over ten kilograms on a rope with a length of two or more meters. If a person pushes upwards against the underneath of the object with one finger they will feel the weight of the object. If they push momentarily against the side of the suspended object with one finger they will feel the mass of the object. (It is important that they do not push the object sideways far enough to begin to raise it.)\\n\\n\\n', \"Xserve\\n\\nThe Xserve is a server made by Apple Inc. which started in 2002.

Zevon wrote many songs that were humorous and often political\\n\\nMany famous musicians have said they liked Zevon\\'s work, including Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young. His most famous songs include \"Werewolves of London\", \"Lawyers, Guns and Money\", \"Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner\" and \"Johnny Strikes Up The Band.\" All of these are from his third and most famous album: \"Excitable Boy\" (1978). Zevon has written many songs that were recorded by other artists. These include \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\" (a top 40 hit by Linda Ronstadt), \"Accidentally Like a Martyr,\" \"Mohammed\\'s Radio,\" \"Carmelita\", and \"Hasten Down the Wind\".\\n\\nZevon sometimes recorded or sang cover songs. He liked to sing Bob Dylan\\'s \"Knockin\\' on Heaven\\'s Door\" and Leonard Cohen\\'s \"First We Take Manhattan\". He was often a guest on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" and the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". Letterman later sang with Zevon on \"Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)\" with Paul Shaffer and members of the CBS Orchestra.\\n\\nHe had a lot of problems in his life, including divorce, alcoholism, and suicide attempts. He also had a paranoia of doctors and this killed him: he did not know he had cancer until doctors could not help him.\\n\\nZevon was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were to William Zevon, a Secular Jew and Beverly Cope Simmons, a Mormon from Salt Lake City, Utah. They soon moved to Fresno, California. By the age of 13, Zevon sometimes visited Igor Stravinsky where he studied modern classical music. Zevon\\'s parents divorced when he was 16 years old. After the divorce, he dropped out of high school and moved from Los Angeles to New York to become a folk singer.\\n\\nIn 1978, Zevon released his most popular and critically acclaimed album \"Excitable Boy\". Radio stations often played the songs off the album, especially \"Werewolves of London.\" \"Werewolves of London\" and \"Excitable Boy\" were both examples of black humor (jokes about bad things). The album also had the songs \"Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner\" and \"Lawyers, Guns and Money,\" which were both deadpan humor songs about geopolitics.\\n\"Rolling Stone\" named the album one of the most important albums in the 1970s. They said that he, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, and Bruce Springsteen were four of the best new artists to emerge in the 1970s.\\n\\nAfter \"Excitable Boy\" Warren Zevon published \"Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School\" in 1980. This album had the only other song recorded by Zevon that reached the Billboard Top 100: \"A Certain Girl.\" \"A Certain Girl\" is a rhythm and blues song written by Allen Toussaint.\\n\\nThis album was dedicated to Ken Millar, who calls himself \"Ross Macdonald.\" Millar is a writer who writes mystery novels, and Zevon really liked Millar\\'s stories. He met Millar in an intervention put together by the journalist Paul Nelson. For awhile this intervention helped Zevon not drink too much alcohol.\\nWarren Zevon did not like to go to the doctor, and never went to one when he was an adult. Before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and started to have a chronic cough. When Zevon told his dentist his problems, his dentist recommended seeing a doctor. When he finally visited one, the doctor diagnosed him with mesothelmia.\\n\\nWarren Zevon did not want to get treated for his cancer if it might keep him from making music. So instead he started to make his final album, titled \"The Wind\". He had a lot of friends who helped him make the album.

It existed from 1922 until 1991, and was the first country to declare itself socialist and build towards a communist society. It was a union of 14 Soviet Socialist Republics and 1 Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Soviet Russia).\\n\\nSoviet Russia was created in 1917 after Vladimir Lenin led the overthrow of Alexander Kerensky. Soviet Russia joined Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, and Ukraine in 1922 to form the Soviet Union. The communist government developed industry and over time became a major, powerful union. The largest country in the Union was Russia, and Kazakhstan was the second. The capital city of Soviet Russia and the Union was Moscow. Although technically countries could become independent if they wanted, in practice it was a completely centralized government, with no states\\' rights for the member countries. Many believe that the Soviet Union was the final stage of the Russian Empire; since the USSR covered most of the land of the former Empire.\\n\\nThe Union was formed with the professed idea to give everyone equal social and economic rights. There was virtually no private property - everything belonged to the state. \"Soviets\", or workers\\' councils were created to speak for the workers, and served as an elite group to govern them. It was successful in many fields; putting the first man and satellite into space and winning World War II alongside the United States and United Kingdom. However, its centralized government found innovation and change difficult to handle. The union collapsed in 1991, partly due to the efforts at reform by its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.\\n\\nAs of 2017, the document that confirmed the dissolution of the Soviet Union is missing.\\n\\nThe Soviet Union was made of 15 republics. These were either \"Soviet Socialist Republics\", or \"Soviet Socialist Federal Republics\". Each of these republics was independent. They reserved the right to leave the union, which they did in 1991. \\n\\nThe \"Federal Republics\" were different in that they had more autonomy, and were made up of states themselves. These were often called \"Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics\". There were a number of them. Most of them still exist; though they are now republics, within the independent state. The \"Tatar ASSR\" turned into the \"Republic of Tatarstan\", for example (It is located around Kazan). \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Soviet Union at its largest size in 1989, with , was the world\\'s biggest country. Covering a sixth of the world\\'s populated land, its size was comparable to North America\\'s. The western part (in Europe) accounted for a quarter of the country\\'s area, and was the country\\'s cultural and economic center. The eastern part (in Asia) extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to the south, and was much less lived in than the western part. It was over across (11 time zones) and almost north to south. Its five climatic (different weather, temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure) zones were tundra, taiga, steppes, desert, and mountains. \\n\\nThe Soviet Union had the world\\'s longest border, measuring over in 1991. Two thirds of the Soviet border was coastline of the Arctic Ocean. Across the Bering Strait was the United States. The Soviet Union bordered Afghanistan, China, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Iran, Mongolia, North Korea, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Turkey at the end of WWII.\\n\\nThe Soviet Union\\'s longest river was the Irtysh. The Soviet Union\\'s highest mountain was Communism Peak (today it is called the Ismail Samani Peak) in Tajikistan measured at . The world\\'s largest lake, the Caspian Sea, was mostly in the Soviet Union. The world\\'s deepest lake, Lake Baikal, was in the Soviet Union.\\n\\nThe last Russian Tsar (translated Caesar, which means emperor), Nicholas II, ruled Russia until March 1917, when the Russian Empire was taken over and a short-lived \"provisional government\" replaced it, led by Alexander Kerensky and soon to be overthrown in November by Bolsheviks. \\n\\nFrom 1917 to 1922, the country that came before the Soviet Union was the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), which was its own country, as were other Soviet republics at the time. The Soviet Union was officially created in December 1922 as the union of the Russian (also known as Bolshevist Russia), Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Transcaucasian Soviet republics ruled by the communist Bolshevik parties.\\n\\nExtreme government-changing activity in the Russian Empire began with the Decembrist Revolt of 1825, and although serfdom was removed in 1861, its removal was achieved on terms unfavorable to the peasants (poor agricultural workers) and served to encourage changers (revolutionaries). A parliament (legislative assembly)—the State Duma—was created in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905, but the Tsar protested people trying to move from absolute to constitutional monarchy. Rebellion continued and was aggravated during World War I by failure and food shortages in popular cities.\\nA rebellion in Saint Petersburg, in response to the wartime decay of Russia\\'s economy and morale, caused the \"February Revolution\" and the removal of the government in March 1917. The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the Russian \"Provisional government\", whose leaders intended to have elections to Russian Constituent Assembly and to continue war on the side of the Entente in World War I.\\n\\nAt the same time, workers\\' councils, known as Soviets, sprang up across the country. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, pushed for socialist revolution in the Soviets and on the streets. In November 1917, during the \"October Revolution\", they took power from the Provisional Government. In December, the Bolsheviks signed an armistice (peace) with the Central Powers. In March, after more fighting, the Soviets quit the war for good and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.\\n\\nIn the long and bloody Russian Civil War the new Soviet power won. The civil war between the Reds and the Whites started in 1917 and ended in 1923. It included the Siberian Intervention and other foreign interference, the killing of Nicholas II and his family and the famine in 1921, which killed about 5 million. In March 1921, during a related conflict with Poland, the Peace of Riga was signed and split disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia. The Soviet Union had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established Republic of Finland, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, and the Republic of Lithuania which had all escaped the empire during the civil war.\\n\\nOn 28 December 1922, people from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty of Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, creating the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. These two documents were made true by the 1st Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by heads of delegations.\\n\\nOn 1 February 1924, the USSR was accepted as a country by the British Empire. Also in 1924, a Soviet Constitution (set of laws) was approved, making true the December 1922 union of the Russian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR, the Belarusian SSR, and the Transcaucasian SFSR to form the \"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" (USSR).\\n\\nThe big changes of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917. A large part of this was performed according to Bolshevik Initial Decrees, documents of the Soviet government, signed by Vladimir Lenin. One of the most important and notable breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan, that planned a major change of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country. The Plan was developed in 1920 and covered a 10- to 15-year period. It included the making of a network of 30 regional power stations, including ten large hydroelectric power plants, and numerous electric-powered large industrial organizations. The Plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans and was basically fulfilled by 1931.\\n\\nFrom its beginning years, government in the Soviet Union was ruled as a one-party state by the Communist Party (Bolsheviks). After the economic policy of War Communism during the Civil War, the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist with nationalized industry in the 1920s and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax (\"see\" New Economic Policy).\\n\\nSoviet leaders argued that one-party rule was necessary because it ensured that \\'capitalist exploitation\\' would not return to the Soviet Union and that the principles of Democratic Centralism would represent the people\\'s will. Debate over the future of the economy provided the background for Soviet leaders to take more power in the years after Lenin\\'s death in 1924. Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a \"troika\" composed of Grigory Zinoviev of Ukraine, Lev Kamenev of Moscow, and Joseph Stalin of Georgia.\\n\\nStalin led the country through World War II and into the Cold War. Gulag camps greatly expanded to take millions of prisoners. After he died, Georgy Malenkov, one of the few top officials he didn\\'t kill, continued his policies. Nikita Khrushchev reversed some of Stalin\\'s policies but Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin kept things as they were. \\n\\nAfter the 1936 revised constitution, the Soviet Union stopped acting as a union of republics and more as a single super-country.\\n\\nLeonid Brezhnev led the Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in 1982. He came to power after he convinced the government to overthrow the then-leader Nikita Krushchev. Brezhnev\\'s rule is often linked with the decline in Soviet economy and starting the chain of events that would lead to the union\\'s eventual collapse. He had many self-awarded medals. He was awarded Hero of the Soviet Union (the highest honor) on three separate occasions. Brezhnev was succeeded by Yuri Andropov, who died a few years later. Andropov was succeeded by the frail and aging Konstantin Chernenko. Chernenko died a mere year after taking office.\\n\\nIn 1980 the Soviet Union hosted the Summer Olympics with Brezhnev opening and closing the games. The games were heavily boycotted by the western nations, particularly the United States. During the closing ceremony, the flag of the City of Los Angeles was raised instead of the flag of the United States (to symbolise the next host city/nation) and the anthem of the Olympics was played instead of the anthem of the United states in response to the boycott. \\n\\nBrezhnev was the second longest serving Soviet leader after Stalin. The Following is a list of leaders (General Secretary of the Communist Party) in order of their tenure and length of leadership:\\nKhrushchev and Gorbachev are the only Soviet leaders to have not died whilst in office. Lenin, Stalin and Khrushchev are the only leaders who were not (de jure) head of state during their leaderships.\\n\\nMikhail Gorbachev was the Soviet Union\\'s last leader. He was the only Soviet leader to have been born after the October revolution and was thus a product of the Soviet Union having grown up in it. He and US president Ronald Reagan signed a treaty to get rid of some nuclear weapons. Gorbachev started social and economic reforms that gave people freedom of speech; which allowed them to criticise the government and its policies. The ruling communist party lost its grip on the media and the people. Newspapers began printing the many failures that the Soviet Union had covered up and denied in its past. The Soviet Union\\'s economy was lagging and the government was spending a lot of money on competing with the west.\\n\\nBy the 1980s the Soviet economy was suffering but it was stable. Gorbachev\\'s new ideas had got out of hand and the communist party lost control. Boris Yeltsin was elected (democratically) the President of the Russian SFSR even though Gorbachev did not want him to come into power. Lithuania announced its independence from the Union and the Soviet government demanded it surrender its independence or it would send the Red Army to keep order. Gorbachev came up with the idea to keep the Soviet Union together with each republic would be more independent but under the same leader. He wanted to call it the \\'Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics\\' to keep the USSR/Soviet Union title and the CCCP in Russian.\\n\\nA group of communists (unhappy with Gorbachev\\'s idea) tried to take over Moscow and stop the Soviet Union from collapsing. It only made people want independence more. Although he survived the attempted takeover, he lost all of his power outside of Moscow. Russia declared independence in December 1991. Later in the month, leaders of Russia, Byelorussia and Ukraine signed a treaty called the Belavezha Agreement to dissolve the USSR; angering Gorbachev. It was agreed that the USSR government must end operations by January 1st, 1992. The Soviet Union\\'s parliament (Supreme Soviet) ratified the Belavezha Accords law in a 45 minute session in the Kremlin on December 26th, 1991, marking the dissolution of the Soviet Government, and Soviet Union. The day before, December 25th, 1991, the red flag was lowered from the Kremlin, ending 74 years of soviet rule in Russia.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Aquele Beijo\\n\\nAquele Beijo (\"That Kiss\") is a Brazilian historical telenovela.

This allows the CPUs control logic to handle instructions at the processing rate of the slowest step, which is much faster than the time needed to process the instruction as a single step.\\n\\nThe term pipeline refers to the fact that each step is carrying a single microinstruction (like a drop of water), and each step is linked to another step (analogy; similar to water pipes).\\n\\nMost modern CPUs are driven by a clock. The CPU consists internally of logic and memory (flip flops). When the clock signal arrives, the flip flops store their new value then the logic requires a period of time to decode the flip flops new values. Then the next clock pulse arrives and the flip flops store another values, and so on. By breaking the logic into smaller pieces and inserting flip flops between pieces of logic, the time required by the logic (to decode values till generating valid outputs depending on these values) is reduced. In this way the clock period can be reduced.<br>For example, the RISC pipeline is broken into five stages with a set of flip flops between each stage as follow:\\n\\nProcessors with pipelining consist internally of stages (modules) which can semi-independently work on separate microinstructions. Each stage is linked by flip flops to the next stage (like a \"chain\") so that the stage\\'s output is an input to another stage until the job of processing instructions is done. Such organization of processor internal modules reduces the instruction\\'s overall processing time.\\n\\nA non-pipeline architecture is not as efficient because some CPU modules are idle while another module is active during the instruction cycle. Pipelining does not completely remove idle time in a pipelined CPU, but making CPU modules work in parallel increases instruction throughput.\\n\\nAn instruction pipeline is said to be \"fully pipelined\" if it can accept a new instruction every clock cycle. A pipeline that is not fully pipelined has wait cycles that delay the progress of the pipeline.\\n\\nAdvantages of Pipelining:\\n\\nDisadvantages of Pipelining:<br>\\n\\nTo the right is a generic pipeline with four stages:\\n\\nThe top gray box is the list of instructions waiting to be executed; the bottom gray box is the list of instructions that have been completed; and the middle white box is the pipeline.\\n\\nExecution is as follows:\\n\\nWhen a \"hiccup\" (interruption) in execution occurs, a \"bubble\" is created in the pipeline in which nothing useful happens. In cycle 2, the fetching of the purple instruction is delayed and the decoding stage in cycle 3 now contains a bubble. Everything behind the purple instruction is delayed as well but everything in front of the purple instruction continues with execution.\\n\\nClearly, when compared to the execution above, the bubble yields a total execution time of 8 clock ticks instead of 7.\\n\\nBubbles are like stalls (delays), in which nothing useful will happen for the fetch, decode, execute and writeback. It is like a NOP (short for No OPeration) code.\\n\\nA typical instruction to add two numbers might be codice_1, which adds the values found in memory locations A and B, and then puts the result in memory location C. In a pipelined processor the pipeline controller would break this into a series of tasks similar to:\\n\\nThe locations \\'R1\\' and \\'R2\\' are registers in the CPU. The values stored in memory locations labeled \\'A\\' and \\'B\\' are loaded (copied) into these registers, then added, and the result is stored in a memory location labeled \\'C\\'.\\n\\nIn this example the pipeline is three stages long- load, execute, and store. Each of the steps are called pipeline stages.\\n\\nOn a non-pipelined processor, only one stage can be working at a time so the entire instruction has to complete before the next instruction can begin. On a pipelined processor, all of the stages can be working at once on different instructions. So when this instruction is at the execute stage, a second instruction will be at the decode stage and a 3rd instruction will be at the fetch stage.\\n\\nTo better understand the concept, we can look at a theoretical 3-stage pipeline:\\n\\nand a pseudo-code assembly listing to be executed:\\n\\nThis is how it would be executed:\\n\\nThe LOAD instruction is fetched from memory.\\n\\nThe LOAD instruction is executed, while the MOVE instruction is fetched from memory.\\n\\nThe LOAD instruction is in the Store stage, where its result (the number 40) will be stored in the register A.\\nIn the meantime, the MOVE instruction is being executed. \\nSince it must move the contents of A into B, it must wait for the ending of the LOAD instruction.\\n\\nThe STORE instruction is loaded, while the MOVE instruction is finishing off and the ADD is calculating.\\n\\nAnd so on. Note that, sometimes, an instruction will depend on the result of another one (like our MOVE example). When more than one instruction references a particular location for an operand, either reading it (as an input) or writing it (as an output), executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can lead to the hazards situation (mentioned above).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Fungus\\n\\nA fungus (plural: fungi) is a kind of living organism: yeasts, moulds and mushrooms are types of fungi. The fungi are a separate kingdom of living things, different from animals and plants.\\n\\nFungi have cells with nuclei. Their cell walls contain chitin, unlike the cell walls of plants, which contain cellulose. These and other differences show that the fungi form a single group of related organisms, called the Eumycota or Eumycetes. They share a common ancestor and are monophyletic group.\\n\\nTheir basic mode of life is \"saprophytic\": a fungus breaks down dead organic matter around it, and uses it as food.\\n\\nFungi reproduce both sexually and asexually. Some fungi grow mushrooms: these are fruiting bodies. Under the cap there are gills; the gills bear spores that will disperse, and may develop into new fungi. Otherwise, fungi use a sporangium to bear asexual spores by mitosis, or sexual spores by meiosis. The spores are haploid.\\n\\nFungi may be single celled or multicellular. Yeast is single-celled, and reproduces either sexually or asexually. Asexual reproduction occurs by simple budding (binary fission).\\n\\nThe mycelium is the vegetative (non-reproductive) part of a fungus. It is usually underground (or inside some another substance), and made of filaments called hyphae.\\n\\nHyphae look like threads, or rootlets. The mat of hyphae may be very thickly woven. The fungus uses them to extract nutrients.\\n\\nHyphae are usually syncytia. This means the cell walls (septa) are mostly not complete, and the cell nuclei are not separated from each other as in normal cells. Details differ between species.\\n\\nSymbiosis means living together. Lichens are a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or bacterium. In this partnership the algal cells live inside the fungus tissue. The end result is a new mat-like life-form which clings to rock and other surfaces. About 20% of all fungi are lichenized.\\n\\nAnother important kind of symbiosis is mycorrhiza. This is when a fungus lives inside plant roots; most trees have mycorrhizal roots, and so do many crop plants. Both sides benefit in this arrangement.\\n\\nSome fungi cause crop diseases; others cause serious disease in humans. Some are highly poisonous: never eat a mushroom picked in the wild unless you know what you are doing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Everett L.

Hikers (the people who do hiking) enjoy fresh air and the beauty of nature. Hiking can also be an attraction for people who enjoy challenging their physical and mental strength. Hiking gives them the chance to become stronger.\\n\\nIn general, people can make profit on it for having rest, health, and everyday life.\\n\\nThe three parts to the hiking process are: \\n\\nPlanning means a hiker should decide what he wants from the hike. A traveller should examine the information on landscape, climate, weather, plants, animals, type of ground, and so on. Based on that information, a hiker decides what equipment (tools) he needs. Writing everything on paper is strongly suggested not to forget anything. A hiker should choose the itinerary (the way of the hike).\\n\\nEquipping means getting specialized clothing and equipment. Different suggestions can be found on each point in any hiking book. A hiker is suggested to learn more than one source and work. Equipping sometimes needs getting skills in using the apparatus. Basic skills–different ways of orientation (the ability to find the way, for example)–must be developed before hiking.\\n\\nHiking itself lies in the observation of the presented steps and hiker's skills. There are different hiking tips and suggestions on the internet (see other websites).\\n\\nHiking can quickly become a fight for life. For this reason everything in hiking is very important. Nobody should hike alone, no matter what the situation, until a hiker feels certain of his hiking abilities.\\n\\nEvery hiker should keep in mind that theory is important, but it can hardly replace firsthand experience. To be safe a traveller should have enough experience. A hiker had better start by taking short hikes.\\n\\nA hiker is strongly suggested to check from time to time (at least every hour) whether he is going the right way. On no account should he go on travelling if he finds out he has lost his way. The first thing a hiker should do is find the direction in which he was travelling before getting lost. Using the compass and the map, he should choose a reference point nearby (railway, road, river, etc.).\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Violet Baudelaire\\n\\nViolet Baudelaire is a fictional character in the popular children\\'s book series, \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" by Lemony Snicket.

There are about 500 different species. \\n\\nSalamanders live in water and on land, and look rather like lizards, with four legs and a tail. They hatch as larvae from eggs in the water. At that stage, they have gills that stick out. \\n\\nMost salamanders live on land when they are adults, after their change of shape (metamorphosis). On land, salamanders live in moist habitats. Their method of respiration varies. Some salamanders stay in the water, but look like adults. These are called newts. Some salamanders retain gills into sexual maturity, such as the Axolotl. This process is called neoteny. \\n\\nOften, salamanders may have a chemical defence to predators; they are poisonous to eat. In this case, they will have warning colouration. Otherwise, if not poisonous, they will usually have camouflage.\\n\\nSalamanders are the only tetrapods able to regenerate limbs, as well as other body parts.\\n\\nRespiration differs between species of salamanders. Species that lack lungs respire through gills. In most cases, these are external gills, visible as tufts on either side of the head, although the amphiumas have internal gills and gill slits. Some salamanders that are terrestrial have lungs that are used in respiration, although these are simple and sac-like, unlike the more complex organs found in mammals. Many species, such as the Olm, have both lungs and gills as adults. \\n\\nSome terrestrial species lack both lungs and gills and perform gas exchange through their skin, a process known as valerian respiration in which the capillary beds are spread throughout the epidermis, and inside the mouth. Even some species with lungs can also respire through the skin in this manner.\\n\\nThe skin of salamanders secretes mucus. This helps to keep the animal moist when on dry land, and maintains their salt balance while in water, as well as providing a lubricant during swimming. Salamanders also secrete poison from glands in their skin, and some additionally have skin glands for secreting courtship pheromones.\\n\\nHunting is yet another unique aspect of salamanders. In the lungless salamanders, muscles surrounding the hyoid bone contract to create pressure and actually \"shoot\" the hyoid bone out of the mouth along with the tongue. The tip of the tongue is composed of a mucus which creates a sticky end to which the prey is captured. Muscles in the pelvic region are used in order to reel the tongue and the hyoid back to its original position. \\n\\nMany of the highly aquatic species, however, have no muscles in the tongue, and do not use it for capturing prey, while most other species have a mobile tongue, but without the adaptations to the hyoid bone. Most species of salamander have small teeth in both the upper and lower jaws. Unlike frogs, even the larvae of salamanders possess these teeth.\\n\\nTo find their prey, salamanders use trichromatic color vision in the ultraviolet range. Permanently subterranean salamanders have reduced eyes, which may even be covered by a layer of skin. The larvae, and the adults of some highly aquatic species, also have a lateral line organ, similar to that of fish, which can detect changes in water pressure. Salamanders have no external ear, and only a vestigial middle ear.\\n\\nSalamanders can drop their tail to escape predators. The tail will drop off and wriggle around for a little while, and the salamanders will either run away or stay still enough to not be noticed while the predator is distracted. Salamanders routinely regenerate complex tissues. Within only a few weeks of losing a piece of limb, a salamander perfectly reforms the missing structure.\\n\\nThere are ten families in the order Urodela, divided into three suborders:\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"Justice for Sisters\\n\\nJustice for Sisters is a non-profit organization that works for rights for transgender people in Malaysia.

It is based on measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium (K) into argon (Ar). \\n\\nPotassium is a common element found in many materials, such as micas, clay, tephra, and evaporites. In these materials, the decay product Ar is able to escape the liquid (molten) rock, but starts to build up when the rock solidifies (recrystallises). Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of Ar to the amount of K remaining. The long half-life of K is more than a billion years, so the method is used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years.\\n\\nQuickly cooled lavas make nearly ideal samples for K–Ar dating. They also preserve a record of the direction and intensity of the local magnetic field at that time. The geomagnetic polarity time scale was calibrated largely using K–Ar dating.\\n\\n\\n', 'Suicide prevention\\n\\nSuicide prevention refers to the efforts of local organizations, mental health doctors and nurses and psychologists to stop people from attempting suicide. One thing to do is stop people who are about to attempt suicide. Another way to stop people from attempting suicide is to treat the symptoms of depression, help people to cope during a time of crisis, reduce the issues that put people at risk of attempting suicide, and give people hope for a better future. \\n\\nSuicide is not just a medical or mental health issue. Making sure people have friends and family to help them and taking away dangerous items can also stop people from attempting suicide.\\n\\nIn the U.S., there is a National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. It was created by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2001. Suicide prevention activities include messages aimed at people and messages for everyone in the community.\\n\\nIn 2001, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services created a National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. The document looks at how suicide can be stopped in the community. The strategy does not say how to help individual people. The document has the following goals:\\n\\n\\nTo help stop people from attempting suicide, many methods have been used:\\nIt has also been suggested that news media can help prevent suicide by linking suicide with negative results, such as pain for the pain felt by the family.\\n\\nMany methods of stopping suicide exist. These include talking to the person, looking for risks, and making it harder for people to get dangerous items.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization says a good way to help people who are suicidal is to talk to them. The person can also be asked about depression, and if they plan to attempt suicide. Talking with people about suicide does not create suicidal thoughts.The doctor has to show concern and compassion. Doctors should try to reduce sadness and let the person know that people care. The WHO says not to not say everything will be all right. However, some people who have talked about suicide have attempted it. This means that doctors need to make sure the person is comfortable talking about his or her feelings.\\n\\nThe U.S. Surgeon General says there are ways to find out which people are at risk of suicide. This may be the best way to stop children and adolescents from attempting suicide.\\nThere are tools like questionnaires to help doctors to know who is at risk. One example is the Beck Hopelessness Scale. These questionnaires are good for finding adolescents and young adults who might want to attempt suicide. Doctors should interview people who seem to be at risk. Questionnaires may not always tell doctors which person will attempt suicide Asking about suicide does not increase the risk.\\n\\nIn approximately 75 percent of suicides, the people had seen a doctor in the last year. About 45 to 66 percent of people saw a doctor the month they committed suicide. About 33 to 41 percent of those who committed suicide had used mental health services in the prior year. About 20 percent used mental health services in the month before they committed suicide. This shows that doctors need to get better at knowing which people will attempt suicide.\\n\\nAn important part of suicide prevention is making it hard for people to get dangerous items. Making it hard for people to get dangerous items can lead to less suicides. Putting up fences at bridges and cliffs reduces suicides. Putting up signs or increasing patrols is not so helpful One example of making dangerous items less available is coal gas in the United Kingdom. Until the 1950s, the most common way of committing suicide in the UK was poisoning by inhaling coal gas. In 1958, natural gas was used instead. Natural gas is much less dangerous. So less people committed suicide.\\nIn the United States,studies show that firearms increase suicide risk. Because guns are quick and more dangerous than other suicide method, they lead to more suicides.\\n\\nTreatments to reduce the risk of suicide can include medical approaches, prescription medicine, and talk therapy.\\n\\nAbout 10% of people with psychiatric problems may have a medical condition that the doctor does not know about which is causing their symptoms. About 50% may have a medical condition that the doctor does not know about which is making their symptoms worse. Illegal drugs and prescribed medications may also cause problems. Treating medical conditions may reduce the risk of suicidal ideas. \\n\\nRecent research shows that lithium lowers the risk of suicide for people with bipolar disorder.\\n\\nTalk therapy can reduce suicidal ideas such as Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Benefits include a reduction in self-harm behaviour and suicidal ideas. Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CBT-SP) helps adolescents at high risk of suicide attempts.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization states that \"worldwide, suicide is among the top five causes of mortality in the 15- to 19-year age group. In many countries it ranks first or second as a cause of death among both boys and girls in this age group\". The organization says teens need help with difficult and stressful life situations.\" It also says that teachers need to prevent bullying and violence at schools.\\n\\nMany non-profit organizations exist that try to prevent suicide. Examples include the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in the United States, which provide crisis hotlines. In addition, some groups such as To Write Love on Her Arms use social media to reach more people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'James Baskett\\n\\nJames Baskett (February 16, 1904 – July 9, 1948) was an American actor.

Just as a line integral handles one dimension or one variable, a surface integral can be thought of being double integral along two dimensions. Given a surface, one may integrate over its scalar fields (that is, functions which return numbers as values), and vector fields (that is, functions which return vectors as values). \\n\\nSurface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the classical theory of electromagnetism. \\n\\nConsider a surface \"S\" on which a scalar field \"f\" is defined. If one thinks of \"S\" as made of some material, and for each x in \"S\" the number \"f\"(x) is the density of material at x, then the surface integral of \"f\" over \"S\" is the mass per unit thickness of \"S\". (This is only true if the surface is an infinitesimally thin shell.) One approach to calculating the surface integral is then to split the surface in many very small pieces, assume that on each piece the density is approximately constant, find the mass per unit thickness of each piece by multiplying the density of the piece by its area, and then sum up the resulting numbers to find the total mass per unit thickness of \"S\".\\n\\nTo find an explicit formula for the surface integral, mathematicians parameterize \"S\" by considering on \"S\" a system of curvilinear coordinates, like the latitude and longitude on a sphere. Let such a parameterization be x(\"s\", \"t\"), where (\"s\", \"t\") varies in some region \"T\" in the plane. Then, the surface integral is given by\\n\\nwhere the expression between bars on the right-hand side is the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives of x(\"s\", \"t\").\\n\\nFor example, to find the surface area of some general functional shape, say formula_2, we have\\nwhere formula_4. So that formula_5, and formula_6. So, \\nwhich is the formula used for the surface area of a general functional shape. One can recognize the vector in the second line above as the normal vector to the surface.\\n\\nNote that because of the presence of the cross product, the above formulas only work for surfaces embedded in three dimensional space.\\n\\nConsider a vector field v on \"S\", that is, for each x in \"S\", v(x) is a vector.\\n\\nThe surface integral can be defined component-wise according to the definition of the surface integral of a scalar field; the result is a vector. For example, this applies to the electric field at some fixed point due to an electrically charged surface, or the gravity at some fixed point due to a sheet of material. It can also calculate the magnetic flux through a surface.\\n\\nAlternatively, mathematicians can integrate the normal component of the vector field; the result is a scalar. An example is a fluid flowing through \"S\", such that v(x) determines the velocity of the fluid at x. The flux is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through \"S\" in a unit amount of time. \\n\\nThis illustration implies that if the vector field is tangent to \"S\" at each point, then the flux is zero, because the fluid just flows in parallel to \"S\", and neither in nor out. This also implies that if v does not just flow along \"S\", that is, if v has both a tangential and a normal component, then only the normal component contributes to the flux. Based on this reasoning, to find the flux, we need to take the dot product of v with the unit surface normal to \"S\" at each point, which will give us a scalar field, and integrate the obtained field as above. This gives the formula\\n\\nThe cross product on the right-hand side of this expression is a surface normal determined by the parametrization.\\n\\nThis formula \"defines\" the integral on the left (note the dot and the vector notation for the surface element).\\n\\nVarious useful results for surface integrals can be derived using differential geometry and vector calculus, such as the divergence theorem, and its generalization, Stokes\\' theorem.\\n\\nThe discussion above defined the surface integral by using a parametrization of the surface \"S\". A given surface might have several parametrizations. For example, when the locations of the North Pole and South Pole are moved on a sphere, the latitude and longitude change for all the points on the sphere. A natural question is then whether the definition of the surface integral depends on the chosen parametrization. For integrals of scalar fields, the answer to this question is simple, the value of the surface integral will be the same no matter what parametrization one uses.\\n\\nIntegrals of vector fields are more complicated, because the surface normal is involved. Mathematicians have proved that given two parametrizations of the same surface, whose surface normals point in the same direction, both parametrizations give the same value for the surface integral. If, however, the normals for these parametrizations point in opposite directions, the value of the surface integral obtained using one parametrization is the negative of the one obtained via the other parametrization. It follows that given a surface, we do not need to stick to any unique parametrization; but, when integrating vector fields, we do need to decide in advance which direction the normal will point to and then choose any parametrization consistent with that direction. \\nAnother issue is that sometimes surfaces do not have parametrizations which cover the whole surface; this is true for example for the surface of a cylinder (of finite height). The obvious solution is then to split that surface in several pieces, calculate the surface integral on each piece, and then add them all up. This is indeed how things work, but when integrating vector fields one needs to again be careful how to choose the normal-pointing vector for each piece of the surface, so that when the pieces are put back together, the results are consistent. For the cylinder, this means that if we decide that for the side region the normal will point out of the body, then for the top and bottom circular parts the normal must point out of the body too. \\nLast, there are surfaces which do not have a surface normal at each point with consistent results (for example, the Möbius strip). If such a surface is split into pieces, on each piece a parametrization and corresponding surface normal is chosen, and the pieces are put back together, the normal vectors coming from different pieces cannot be reconciled. This means that at some junction between two pieces will have normal vectors pointing in opposite directions. Such a surface is called non-orientable. Vector fields can not be integrated on non-orientable surfaces.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Pinyin\\n\\nPinyin is the Mandarin word for \"spelling\", writing letters showing the sound of a word in place of a Chinese character. Today, it almost always has the sense of Hanyu\\xa0Pinyin, the way of writing Mandarin sounds which has been used by the People\\'s Republic of China from the 1950s. Other countries like the United States and Taiwan used other ways of spelling Chinese (such as the Wade-Giles way) for a long time, but in the late 20th century started to use Hanyu\\xa0Pinyin as well. It is the standard of China as well as the United Nations.

By the start of 1700\\'s, a lighter type of musket took over from the arquebus. When the bayonet was added, there was no longer a need for pikemen, and almost all infantry soldiers became musketeers. The first musket made in the united States was the Springfield Model 1795 Musket. In the 1800\\'s, better ammunition and ways of firing the gun, meant that rifling was practical for military use, and the rifled musket became common. A few years later, the use of cartridges, breechloading, and multiple rounds of ammunition meant the \"rifled musket\" gave way to the rifle, and \"muskets\" were no longer used.\\n\\nMusket calibres ranged from to . A smoothbore musket, firing at a single target, was only accurate to about to . Rifled muskets in the 1850\\'s were much better, able to hit a man sized target at up to .

It was made for the army of the German Empire in 1905. It was designed for a war between France on one side and the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, and Italy on the other. Germany and her allies would invade France through Belgium. With help from her allies, Germany would have just enough men to beat France in a few months.\\n\\nWhen Schlieffen retired in 1906, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger took over the German Empire\\'s war planning. Moltke got rid of the plan because he was sure that the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom would help France and that Italy would not help Germany. Moltke was right about this. When World War I started, Germany and Austria-Hungary had to fight Russia on the Eastern Front and Italy did not help Germany.\\n\\nEven though he did not have enough men to beat France, Moltke still attacked France through Belgium. He did this because he thought attacking was always better than defending. Moltke was sure that the Russo-Japanese War proved this because Japan always attacked, and Japan won.\\n\\nSchlieffen believed that defending was usually better than attacking. Schlieffen said that a defender\\'s men can ride trains to a place faster than an attacker\\'s men can walk there. This meant that the defender would always have enough men to stop the attacker. Schlieffen also said that trenches, machine guns, and barbed wire would help the defender a lot. Schlieffen was right. In WWI, defense was always better until attackers used lots of artillery to help their infantry.\\n\\nA similar idea to the Schlieffen Plan was used by Hitler\\'s generals Erich von Manstein and Heinz Guderian in World War II. In that war, Germany invaded France by attacking Belgium and The Netherlands. Because in the Schlieffen Plan Germany attacked mostly through northern Belgium, France thought Germany would do this again. France put most of her soldiers in north Belgium. But Germany invaded mostly through \"South\" Belgium. German troops marched to the sea and trapped half of the French Army in northern Belgium. Because the trapped French troops were starving and could not get any more food, they surrendered.
